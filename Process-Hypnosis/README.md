# Process Hypnosis ðŸ¦€

The idea behind Process Hypnosis is to develop a malicious artifact that behaves like a debugger. As a result, we gain the ability to control the execution flow of a program that is being debugged and obtain relevant information from it, such as: creation of new threads, loaded modules, exceptions and much more.
