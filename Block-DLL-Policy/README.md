# Block DLL Policy ðŸ¦€

The `Block DLL Policy` technique is an effective strategy for preventing non-Microsoft-signed DLLs from being loaded into system processes. This policy can be applied both when creating new processes and implemented in our local process.

## Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run --release
```
