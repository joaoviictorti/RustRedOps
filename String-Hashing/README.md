# String Hashing ðŸ¦€

String hashing is a technique used in malware development to transform input data (such as text strings) into a fixed-length string, known as a hash. This process is carried out to hide strings within your code.

## Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run --release
```
