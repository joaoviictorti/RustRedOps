# APC Injection ðŸ¦€

APC injection is an attack technique that exploits Windows' ability to schedule asynchronous procedure calls (APCs). APCs are used to execute code in a process in a specific context, usually as part of system operations. Attackers can exploit this functionality by injecting malicious code into a target process to execute their own instructions. 

- **Local**: Injects and queues an APC into a thread within the same process.
- **Remote (Early Bird)**: Creates a new suspended process, injects the payload, and queues an APC to execute it before the target process starts running normally.

## Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run --release
```
