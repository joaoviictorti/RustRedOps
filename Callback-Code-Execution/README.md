# Callback Code Execution ðŸ¦€

This repository focuses on executing shellcode via callback calls. In the code, we used the `EnumCalendarInfo` function, however, it is important to note that there are several other functions that can also be used for this purpose. 

## Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run --release
```
