# Payload Execution Control ðŸ¦€

Mutexes, events and semaphores are fundamental synchronization mechanisms in operating system programming, especially in the context of payload execution control in malware development. These mechanisms allow processes to coordinate their actions efficiently, ensuring that shared resources are accessed safely and that race conditions are avoided.

## Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run --release
```
