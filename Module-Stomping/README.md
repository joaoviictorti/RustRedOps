# Module Stomping ðŸ¦€

The Module Stomping technique is a way of mapping or loading a DLL in your process or in another process and then retrieving the AddressOfEntryPoint address to replace it with its shellcode and execute it.

## Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run --release
```
