# API Hammering ðŸ¦€

API Hammering consists of a large number of useless Windows API function calls, functions, loops, writing files and so on. 

In the Rust project I present two ways of carrying out this type of action, through file writing and interactions between loops.

With this technique we can escape sandbox analyses by slowly executing our malware.
